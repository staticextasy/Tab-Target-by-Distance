# Tab Target by Distance

## What the mod does:
Modifies tab targeting by scanning targets and sorting them by distance. Adds the ability to reverse tab target with `CTRL+TAB`. Opted not to use `SHIFT+TAB` due to the Steam overlay. May be made configurable in a future release. The distance for tab targeting is also configurable.
